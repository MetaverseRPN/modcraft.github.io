NBT.js
======

by Sijmen Mulder.

NBT.js is a JavaScript parser [NBT](http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt) archives, for use with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).


Usage
-----

After `var nbt = require('nbt')`, you can use `nbt.parse(data, callback)` to convert NBT data into a regular JavaScript object.

    var fs = require('fs'),
    	nbt = require('nbt');

    fs.readFile('bigtest.nbt', function(error, data) {
    	if (error) throw error;

		nbt.parse(data, function(error, result) {
	    	console.log(result.Level.stringTest);
	    	console.log(result.Level['nested compound test']);
		});
    });

If the data is gzipped, it is automatically decompressed first.

Tag names are copied verbatim, and as some names are not valid JavaScript names, use of the indexer may be required â€“ such as with the nested compound test in the example above.

Byte arrays are returned as Node.js [`Buffer`](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) objects.


Development and testing
-----------------------

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is used as a task runner:

    grunt jshint        # Check code quality
    grunt jasmine_node  # Run tests
    grunt watch         # Do the above two on every file change

The test coverage is very basic and could be extended.


Known issues
------------

 * [64 bit integers overflow](https://github.com/sjmulder/nbt-js/issues/1)
 * Tests are minimal, hence the validity of many of the parsing function is uncertain.
