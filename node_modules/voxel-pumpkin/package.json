By default,\npumpkins can only be carved once, but the `allowRecarving` option can be set to allow\nshears to change the carved side even if it has already been carved once.\n\nYou can also \"light up\" or extinguish pumpkins by right-clicking with a lighter;\nthis turns a carved pumpkin into a jack-o'-lantern or vice versa.\n\nWhen a block is mined, it drops (using [voxel-harvest](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-harvest))\nan item which has no direction, unlike the blocks. Using this item by right-clicking in the world\n(with [voxel-use](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-use)) places a block with an appropriate\ndirection such that the carved side faces the player. In this way, blocks can be picked up\nas items and reoriented by the player.\n\nFor another, simpler, example of block metadata, see also [voxel-wool](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-wool).\n\nNote: the above screenshot uses the [ProgrammerArt](https://github.com/deathcap/ProgrammerArt) v2.0\ntexture pack, but other packs can be used; for example, here are some pumpkins\nincluding a jack-o'-lantern and carved pumpkin\nusing the [Sphax](http://bdcraft.net/) 64x texture pack (not included):\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kPXHIhT.png \"Screenshot\")\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n",
