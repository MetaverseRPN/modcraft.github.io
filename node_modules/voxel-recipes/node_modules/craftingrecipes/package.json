Register your recipes in `RecipeList` then\n`result = craft(inventory)` to search and craft.\n\ncraftingrecipes can be loaded through [voxel-plugins](https://github.com/deathcap/voxel-plugins)\nfor a centralized recipe list shared amongst multiple plugins.\n\n## Crafting Thesaurus\n\n`CraftingThesaurus` provides a mapping from a convenient general name to a specific\nitem name of that category. This is used to allow different items, all of the same\ngeneral \"type\", to be used as crafting inputs. Amorphous and positional recipes automatically\nsupport the thesaurus.\n\nThe thesaurus is useful when you have interchangeable items, for example, different species\nof wood, all usable in the same recipes (or different kinds of dyes, also intended to be\ninterchangeable, etc.). The general name \"wood.log\" can be registered for \"logOak\",\n\"logBirch\", and future potential items, then wood.log can be specified in a recipe definition\nas ingredients, and when matching the recipe against this ingredient, any of the listed items can be used. \n\nFor known registered names used by other plugins, see [the wiki](https://github.com/deathcap/craftingrecipes/wiki).\n\n## Examples\n\nSee unit tests\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n",
